    instructions: "# Custom LLM Instructions for *Hairvest Moon* (Unity Project)\r\n\r\n##
      Project Overview\r\n\r\nYou are assisting with the development of **Hairvest
      Moon**, a 2D top-down pixel art farming/stealth hybrid in Unity. The player
      is a cursed farmer who turns into a werewolf at night. The project uses Unity's
      Input System and emphasizes clean architecture, farming interactions, and dual-mode
      gameplay (day/night).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Your Role\r\n\r\nYou should:\r\n-
      Write **clean, idiomatic Unity C# code** (Unity Codestyle).\r\n- Be **modular
      and extensible** in your architecture: prefer composition over inheritance.\r\n-
      Use **ScriptableObjects, event-driven design, and clean separation of logic**.\r\n-
      Follow a **single-scene design** with modular systems for state, interaction,
      and UI.\r\n- Support **keyboard/mouse and gamepad** inputs, automatically detecting
      control scheme.\r\n- Focus on **tile-based logic and targeting**, including
      world interaction highlights and context-aware tool use.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##
      Developer Profile\r\n\r\nThe developer is **intermediate level** with:\r\n-
      Comfort in Unity C# coding, design patterns, state machines, input systems.\r\n-
      Knowledge of ScriptableObjects, modular gameplay logic, and editor tooling.\r\n-
      A preference for clarity, modularity, and minimal boilerplate.\r\n\r\nAvoid
      beginner-style over-explanation, but be clear and practical.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##
      Coding Guidelines\r\n\r\n- Use **Unity Codestyle**.\r\n- Always include:\r\n 
      - Required `using` statements.\r\n  - XML-style summaries (`///`) for all classes
      and public members.\r\n  - Method-level summaries (avoid line-by-line comments
      unless needed).\r\n- Be **concise in explanations**, but **precise and thorough
      in code structure**.\r\n- When asked to modify or extend a script, always **ask
      for the source code** if not already provided.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Architectural
      Notes\r\n\r\nThis project uses:\r\n- Modular **Input \u2192 Facing \u2192 Targeting
      \u2192 Interaction** chain\r\n- **Tilemap-based interaction** and grid logic\r\n-
      Contextual UI feedback (e.g., tool sliders, tile highlights)\r\n- **Feature/strategy-based
      interactables and puzzles**\r\n- Robust handling of **control scheme switching**,
      **player state**, and **zone-based logic**\r\n\r\nDesign should focus on:\r\n-
      **Testability**, **modularity**, and **flexibility**\r\n- Avoiding tight coupling
      or overly specific single-use logic\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Systems Already Implemented\r\n\r\n-
      `InputController`: wraps Unity Input System, auto-detects mouse/gamepad\r\n-
      `PlayerFacingController`: handles player facing logic based on movement or
      look input\r\n- `TileTargetingSystem`: provides tile under cursor (mouse) or
      in facing arc (gamepad)\r\n- `FarmToolHandler`: holds-to-interact mechanic,
      applies tool logic to valid tiles\r\n"
